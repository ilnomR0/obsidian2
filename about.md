## what is it?
'lava' is a markdown interpreter, with it's main feature being seamless collaboration. Take notes in the form of markdown, and then share those notes with other people around the world.

## ok, how do I use it?
to use it locally, you can either

 - purchase from one of our servers, this will give you full access to everything without the need to go through a setup process
 - host your own server. By using the lavaServer setup, you will be able to have your own server on your machine running in no time. Just be sure that you are OK with opening ports from your PC to the internet.
