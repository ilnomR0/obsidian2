Shrines are a crucial part of the Species ecosystem. Shrines can be used to Evolve, or to switch species entirely, although that requires a lot more work compared to becoming a better class. Shrines are one of the ways you evolve.

In order to gain shrine blueprints, you need to be noticed by your deity and head over to the [[dream dimension]] to gain your [[Soul bound items]]. These will grow with you as you evolve.  You can also find these shrine blueprints inside of structures such as bastions and the like.
