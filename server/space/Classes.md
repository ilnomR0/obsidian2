# about the class system
The class system works as if it were a tree-upgrade system. You first select the class you want to pursue. As you gain levels and achievements; you level up your class. Going into branches, as things that could've been will not be.

After you max out one path, you can either upgrade to a better version of that class, adding more possible branches, or choose a different class. You will be able to switch back to your class, but it will reset the class level back to 1.
# selecting your class

In order to select your class, you must go to a village and talk to the job applicant. The job applicant will give you a job to be working on for a good while, and you will be able to talk to him about training and upgrading your class further and further.
